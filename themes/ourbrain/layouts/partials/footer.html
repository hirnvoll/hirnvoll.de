<!--
Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line.
While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers,
this element is now defined in semantic terms,
rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line,
you should do so using appropriate CSS.
